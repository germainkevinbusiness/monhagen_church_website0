          To be made whole, or to be saved, is to submit to God and His plan and
          purpose for our lives. It is a turning from our old ways and turning
          to Jesus, to ask Him for forgiveness from our sins and to give us new
          life in Him. Romans 10:9 says: “If you declare with your mouth that
          Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the
          dead, you will be saved.” Salvation is God’s free gift to us and we
          become His children. It is an irrevocable acceptance into the family
          of God and it is an empowerment to live life wholly and fully with the
          purpose of reflecting God to the rest of His creation. If you are not
          sure whether you are right with God or you know in fact that you need
          Jesus in your life, you can choose to follow Him right now by praying
          a prayer of surrender to Jesus. Dear Jesus, I’m praying this prayer
          because I know that I have done wrong by living without You. I am
          sorry and I trust that You will forgive me. I accept Your love and
          grace for me and ask that You would be my Lord. Help me believe in You
          and love You every day, and help me to show the world what You are
          like and how great Your love is. In Jesus’ name, amen.
          Congratulations! To pray these words with a surrendered heart to Jesus
          is the beginning of the most important voyage you will ever embark on:
          the journey to follow Jesus. Please let us know if you’ve just made a
          commitment to Jesus and prayed this prayer by clicking the button
