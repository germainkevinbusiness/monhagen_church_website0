        <h3>Leading Our Flock with Faith and Education</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          Bishop Paul D. Laplante is a dedicated leader within the Middletown,
          NY community. <br />
          His passion for music and ministry is evident in his role as Pastor of
          the First Haitian Church of God since 2004.<br />
          Not only does Bishop Laplante guide his congregation, but he's also
          actively involved in broader Christian outreach. <br />
          In 2019, he co-founded and currently chairs the American League of
          Evangelical Pastors (ALEP). <br />
          Throughout his career, Bishop Laplante has continuously expanded his
          knowledge. He began with an Associate Degree in Ministry from World
          Evangelism Fellowship in 1997. He then went on to earn a Bachelor's
          degree in Theology and Bible knowledge from Dr. Edward DeVries' School
          in 2008. <br />
          In 2009, he became an ordained Pastor with the Church of God.<br />
          His dedication to learning continued with a Doctorate in Philosophy
          from Saint Luke Evangelical School of Biblical Studies in 2014. <br />
          Bishop Laplante's impact extends beyond the church walls. <br />
          He actively serves on the Clergy Department Task Force at Garnet
          Health Medical Center (formerly Orange Regional Medical Center).<br />
          He's also a duly accredited Clergyman recognized by the New York City
          Clerk's Office. Education is another cornerstone of Bishop Laplante's
          life. <br />He holds an Associate's degree in Liberal Arts from SUNY
          Rockland Community College, followed by a Bachelor's of Science in
          Communications from SUNY Empire State College in 2013.<br />
          He furthered his academic journey with a Master's of Arts and an
          Advanced Certificate in Work and Public Policy from SUNY Empire State
          College in 2016.<br />
