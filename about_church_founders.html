                Bishop Paul D. Laplante is a dedicated leader within the
                Middletown, New York community. <br />
                His passion for music and ministry is evident in his role as
                Pastor of the FHCOGOM since 2004.<br />
                Not only does Bishop Laplante guide his congregation, but he's
                also actively involved in broader Christian outreach. <br />
                In 2019, he co-founded and currently chairs the American League
                of Evangelical Pastors (ALEP). <br />
                Throughout his career, Bishop Laplante has continuously expanded
                his knowledge. He began with an Associate Degree in Ministry
                from World Evangelism Fellowship in 1997. He then went on to
                earn a Bachelor's degree in Theology and Bible knowledge from
                Dr. Edward DeVries' School in 2008. <br />
                In 2009, he became an ordained Pastor with the Church of God.<br />
                His dedication to learning continued with a Doctorate in
                Philosophy from Saint Luke Evangelical School of Biblical
                Studies in 2014. <br />
                Bishop Laplante's impact extends beyond the church walls. <br />
                He actively serves on the Clergy Department Task Force at Garnet
                Health Medical Center (formerly Orange Regional Medical
                Center).<br />
                He's also a duly accredited Clergyman recognized by the New York
                City Clerk's Office. Education is another cornerstone of Bishop
                Laplante's life. <br />He holds an Associate's degree in Liberal
                Arts from SUNY Rockland Community College, followed by a
                Bachelor's of Science in Communications from SUNY Empire State
                College in 2013.<br />
                He furthered his academic journey with a Master's of Arts and an
                Advanced Certificate in Work and Public Policy from SUNY Empire
                State College in 2016.<br />
                Bishop Laplante and his wife Prisca warmly welcome you to the
                church website. They encourage you to explore and feel free to
                contact them if you have any questions.
